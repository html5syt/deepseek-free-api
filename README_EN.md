# DeepSeek Free API — AstrBot plugin (English)

Lightweight OpenAI-compatible HTTP proxy that forwards requests to DeepSeek's web API. Implemented as an AstrBot plugin, it starts a local HTTP server (default port 5566) when initialized. The implementation focuses on compatibility with DeepSeek web protocols: streaming SSE, deep-thinking (R1), search, expert mode, PoW challenge solving, and optional AstrBot session binding.
Quick highlights:

- OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` (streaming/non-streaming)
- `conversation_id`-based native multi-turn support
- Model keywords: `expert`, `r1`/`think`, `search`, `-silent`, `-fold`
- `/token/check` to verify DeepSeek `userToken`
Repository files of interest:

- `main.py` — core plugin implementation (DeepSeek client, SSE handling, HTTP endpoints)
- `metadata.yaml` — plugin metadata
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies

## Quick start
1. Install Python dependencies (recommended Python 3.9+):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
2. Load as an AstrBot plugin. When AstrBot loads the plugin it calls `initialize()` which starts an HTTP server on the configured `port` (default `5566`).

3. Example request (non-streaming):
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5566/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_USER_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "model": "deepseek-expert",
    "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"Who are you?"}],
    "stream": false
  }
```
Response is OpenAI-compatible. Use the returned `id` as `conversation_id` for server-side multi-turn continuity.

## HTTP endpoints
- `GET /ping` — returns `pong`.
- `GET /v1/models` — list of supported model IDs.
- `POST /v1/chat/completions` — main chat endpoint. Requires `Authorization: Bearer <userToken[,userToken2,...]>` header.
- `POST /token/check` — body `{ "token": "..." }` → `{ "live": true|false }`.

## Model keywords
- `deepseek` — default (maps to V4-Flash)
- `deepseek-expert` — V4-Pro (expert mode)
- `deepseek-r1` — deep thinking / R1
- `deepseek-search` — search-enabled

Combine keywords freely, e.g. `deepseek-expert-r1-search`.
## Configuration (plugin)

- `port` — HTTP port (default `5566`)
- `client_identifier` — when set, AstrBot will include this string in the `X-from-which-astrbot` request header; the plugin detects this header to enable UMO→DeepSeek session binding and injects a nonce into system prompts.
- `deepseek_token` — optional plugin-level DeepSeek refresh token to override incoming Authorization

## Persistence
UMO → conversation_id mappings are stored in `plugin_data/deepseek_free_api/umo_conv.db` (SQLite) under AstrBot data directory.

## Features

### 1. Supported Model List

This project dynamically injects official protocol parameters by parsing keywords in the model name. Features can be combined freely:

| Model ID | Target Backend | Expert Mode | Deep Thinking | Search | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| `deepseek` | **V4-Flash** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Basic chat mode |
| `deepseek-expert` | **V4-Pro** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | **Recommended**: Expert enhanced mode (1M context, Agent-optimized) |
| `deepseek-r1` | **V4-Flash** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | Official R1 deep thinking mode |
| `deepseek-search` | **V4-Flash** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | Official internet search mode |
| `deepseek-expert-r1` | **V4-Pro** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | **Top Reasoning**: V4 Pro + Deep Thinking |
| `deepseek-expert-search` | **V4-Pro** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | V4 Pro + Internet Search |
| `deepseek-r1-search` | **V4-Flash** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | Deep Thinking + Search |
| `deepseek-expert-r1-search` | **V4-Pro** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **Ultimate**: V4 Pro + Thinking + Search |

> **Mapping Logic**: No need to change your model names. The system automatically identifies: names containing `expert` call **V4-Pro**; others default to **V4-Flash**. Include `think` or `r1` for deep thinking, and `search` for internet search. Suffixes `-silent` and `-fold` are supported.

### 2. Magic Triggers

Trigger deep thinking in any model without changing the model name:
- Start your prompt with `?` or `？`.
- Include the phrase `deep thinking` or `深度思考` in your prompt.

### 3. Continuous Conversation

Supports native continuous conversation via `conversation_id` (using server-side memory instead of uploading full history).

- **Usage**: Add `"conversation_id": "YOUR_ID"` to the request body.
- **ID Source**: The `id` field from each API response is the `conversation_id` for the next turn.
- **Format**: `session_id@parent_message_id`.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Save Bandwidth**: No need to resend full chat history.
  - **Native Experience**: Inherits search results, thinking process, and expert state from previous turns.

## Preparation

Please ensure you are in mainland China or have personal computing equipment in mainland China, otherwise, the deployment may not work due to the inability to access DeepSeek.

Get the userToken value from [DeepSeek](https://chat.deepseek.com/)

Start a conversation on DeepSeek, then open the developer tools with F12, and find the value of `userToken` in Application > LocalStorage. This will be used as the Bearer Token value for Authorization: `Authorization: Bearer TOKEN`

![Get userToken](./doc/example-0.png)

### Multi-account Access

Currently, the same account can only have *one* output at a time. You can provide multiple userToken values and concatenate them with `,`:

`Authorization: Bearer TOKEN1,TOKEN2,TOKEN3`

The service will select one for each request.

### Environment Variables (Optional)

| Environment Variable | Required | Description                               |
|------|------|----------------------------------|
|  DEEP_SEEK_CHAT_AUTHORIZATION   | No    | If configured, the token will be used. If not configured, the Authorization header must be provided in the request |

## Notes

### Nginx Reverse Proxy Optimization

If you are using Nginx to reverse proxy deepseek-free-api, please add the following configuration items to optimize the streaming output effect and improve the experience.

```nginx
# Disable proxy buffering. When set to off, Nginx will immediately send the client request to the backend server and immediately send the response received from the backend server back to the client.
proxy_buffering off;
# Enable chunked transfer encoding. Chunked transfer encoding allows the server to send data in chunks for dynamically generated content without knowing the size of the content in advance.
chunked_transfer_encoding on;
# Enable TCP_NOPUSH, which tells Nginx to send data as much as possible before sending the data packet to the client. This is usually used in conjunction with sendfile to improve network efficiency.
tcp_nopush on;
# Enable TCP_NODELAY, which tells Nginx not to delay sending data and to send small data packets immediately. In some cases, this can reduce network latency.
tcp_nodelay on;
# Set the keep-alive timeout, here set to 120 seconds. If there is no further communication between the client and the server during this time, the connection will be closed.
keepalive_timeout 120;
```

### Token Statistics

Since the inference side is not in deepseek-free-api, tokens cannot be counted and will be returned as a fixed number.
